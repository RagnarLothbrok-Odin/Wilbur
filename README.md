Wilbur is a bot with an emphasis on fun. It was created with the intention of being a project made with the community, carefully listening to feedback and suggestions.

You can either host this bot yourself or invite it to your server by [clicking here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1103308818470932653&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=535327927376).

## Trello

You can now follow development and make suggestions/report issues on our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/TpKTayKW/wilbur)

## Usage (Invite)

- Invite the bot by [clicking here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1103308818470932653&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=535327927376).
- Once the bot is in your guild, no configuration should be required! You can just start using its commands.
- You can view available commands by running the following command:

```text
/help
```

## Usage (Self Host)

I am going to assume you have the basics installed on your host/computer (i.e., Node.js, npm, etc.).

- Download the source code by clicking on 'Releases', selecting the latest version, and downloading the source code (zip) file. Alternatively, you can [click here](https://github.com/Valhalla-Development/Wilbur/releases)
- Extract the zip file using software of your choice.
- Inside the extracted folder, you will find a file named .env.example. Open it and add the specified values. After editing the file, rename it to .env. If you are unsure where to find your bot token and owner ID, please refer to these links: [bot token](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token) & [owner id](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)
- Open a console window in the root directory of the bot, then run the following commands:

```text
$ yarn install    // Installs required modules. Once completed, run the next command:
$ yarn start      // Builds and starts your bot. You are now ready to use Wilbur!
```
